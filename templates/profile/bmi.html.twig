    <p>
        BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is in a healthy range.
        It's a useful tool to identify whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
        The calculation divides an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.
        For most adults, an ideal BMI is in the range of 18.5 to 24.9.
    </p>
    <p>
        In your Dietify profile, your BMI is automatically calculated based on the height and weight you have entered.
        Whenever you update your profile with new measurements, your BMI will reflect these changes accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the BMI categories as used in Dietify:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Less than 16: Severely underweight</li>
        <li>16 to 18.5: Underweight</li>
        <li>18.5 to 25: Normal (healthy weight)</li>
        <li>25 to 30: Overweight</li>
        <li>30 to 35: Obese Class I (Moderately obese)</li>
        <li>35 to 40: Obese Class II (Severely obese)</li>
        <li>More than 40: Obese Class III (Very severely obese)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's important to note that BMI is a simple and useful indicator of a healthy body weight, but it doesn't measure body fat directly and can sometimes be misleading, especially in muscular individuals or those with a health condition that affects body weight. Always consult a healthcare provider for the
        most comprehensive assessment of your health.</p>
